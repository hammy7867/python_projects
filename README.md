# python_projects

My name is Alex. I am a computer engineer who recently started programming in python and have come to absolutely love it for it's intuitiveness and ease of use. These are just some random exercises I have done in python. They are serving the dual purpose of acting as a compendium of my code as well as teaching me how to use GitHub.
